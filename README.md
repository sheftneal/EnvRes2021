Code for Heft-Neal et al 2021 [`Associations between wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy and risk of preterm birth in California'](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512101166X) will be posted here shortly.

Note that due to data use agreement we cannot share the data used in the analysis, only the code. Therefore full replication will not be possible (unless you have already independently been granted access to the Vital Records data). However, the code is posted in order to show the exact regressions that were used to dervie the results presented in the paper.
